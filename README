# WaterMark Generator by ALMA 

Here is a simple text and image watermark generation application (Java + JavaFX use) created fully with AI.
Not optimized yet (slow, a lot of GUI issues, etc) but can be used for studying or personal needs.

See a lot of things to do better and gonna improve it at my free time.

If you like it or hate it, let me know.
