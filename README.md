WMG is application for creating text/graphic watermarks on images (Java + JavaFX use) created fully with AI.
Now it supports only png, jpg, jpeg, gif, .bmp images formats

Not optimized yet (slow, a lot of GUI issues, enlarged preview bugs etc) but can be used for educational or personal use.

I see a lot of things to do better and gonna improve it at my free time.
